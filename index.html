        <p class="subtitle">A little (not so little) book about how you became my favorite person. So, you’ve been asking this question for a while now, and I’m finally going to answer it for you, hehe. I’ve really wanted to tell you this for a long time, hehe… but whatever.</p>

        <h2>CHAPTER 1: GLIMPSE</h2>
        <p>So, let’s start from when I first saw you—like THE FIRST time. I might have told you this before, and I know you probably don’t remember it.

During that time, we were both dating different people. That day, we were both coming home from school. At that time, we didn’t even know the other person existed. I used to live in your tower, and I saw you once outside the lift. I didn’t think much of it at that time because I didn’t know you. But I still wondered why you were in the same uniform as me, haha.

And while I was thinking this, your floor came, and you went out. At that time, I didn’t even remember this in such detail, but now that I think about it… it just feels like it was all familiar. Like the floor number, the lift, the timing. Its like it was meant to happen, haha.
 
I’m trying not to sound extremely cliché here… but whatever, bear with it.</p>

        <h2>CHAPTER 2: INTUITION</h2>
        <p>Now, this is a very long story, so I’ll try to make it as short as possible because I know your attention span would literally kill me. 
Before we became friends, I had this moment.. and it was something i different. So basically.. I saw you one more time in J Tower. before we actually became friends. I don’t remember what I was doing or where I was going at that time.. but I remember that moment so clearly.

I was going to the lift, and you were coming out. I didn’t even see your face, but I still recognized that it was you- AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME HAHA. And I had this feeling I dont know what it was- it was just this feeling. Like I just knew that we were either going to date in the future or we were ATLEAST going to be friends. But at the very least, I knew we were going to talk one day, and it would be nice. I still don’t know why i got that feeling haha (maybe because we are soulmates or whatever ;p)

        <h2>CHAPTER 3: BEGINNING</h2>
        <p class="list">
           Skipping to the part after we became friends… it was nice and sweet..and I felt comfortable. At that time, we were a trio, and we hung out together or whatever, but it was always so boring without you. You were just so fun to hang out with.

I honestly love the part where we actually started ditching the people who introduced us and then started ditching others in general just to hang out with each other, hahahaha. ANYWAYS.

Slowly, we started to become best friends (just friends), lmao. It’s funny to think about it now. 

Ditching people was so fun because it meant we would hang out together. Alone. It was the best part of my day.Obviously, as just friends xD

        <h2>CHAPTER 4: SOMETHING IS GOING ON.</h2>
        <p>As time passed, we just grew closer. It felt like there was no one else in the world who understood us the way we understood each other. 
It was like we were two penguins waddling around in our own little world, and the rest were just birdies trying to poke us with their beaks, haha. But tbh, none of that mattered, because as long as we had each other, everything felt okay.
That feeling is something really special, babyy. </p>

        <h2>CHAPTER 5: 'MINE'CRAFT</h2>
        <p>I don’t even think I need to explain this, honestly. I mean, no “just friends” stay up playing Minecraft till 6 a.m. and then accidentally place their beds next to each other in a cute little cherry house.

Now, I know you’ll say it was you who placed the bed, but there’s a very valid reason I never removed it, okay? And wow… did I just make “placing Minecraft beds next to each other” significant? IT’S NOT THAT DEEP. Probably. Whatever.

And the Sky Garden… and the Cozy Island😭 how can we forget those?

The thing is, the nights we spent playing games probably weren’t that deep, but they were special. And honestly, Minecraft and Roblox were just our way of flirting, hahaha.</p>

        <h2>CHAPTER 6: 11 OCTOBER, 2024</h2>
        <p>Navratri. Tbh, This was one of the best days of my life. Why? Well… I think that’s pretty self-understood, haha.

That day is really close to my heart, and I don’t think it can ever be recreated. It was just… special.

Your friends had invited you, and yet you still invited me. You didn’t make me feel left out or alone not even for a second. You listened to me. My friends had ditched me, I was upset, and I basically ran away. And even then, you left everyone else and came looking for me. I remember that day very clearly, but what i remember the most is how you showed me that you genuinely cared. That feeling is something I’ll never forget.

I was crying on what was supposed to be a really good day, and you were there, comforting me. I had never felt that before like someone truly cared about how I felt.

And then there was that walk, after I was done crying. It honestly felt like a walk of faith or whtever. What I mean is that walk was a turning point? Ig it was.. or both of us lmao. We walked from the club to the market and then back to the club. It was the same route, but everything felt different.

While walking to the market, I was sad, upset, angry, and felt completely alone. But on the way back, something changed. I started to realize how special you were to me. All the feelings of possessiveness and that quiet, secret jealousy I never told anyone about suddenly made sense. That’s when I realized I had started liking you a long time ago.</p>

        <h2>CHAPTER 7: Drunk Diaries</h2>
        <p>I still remember the tension we used to have when we were “just friends, drunk.” This chapter is short and sweet… and probably the last one. AAAAA okay.

We’ve had way too many drunk moments for people who were “just friends.” Like that one time we literally stole my parents’ old monk bottle, finished it, got drunk, and then went and slept in their room. We even kind of cuddled… obviously, just as friends 💀😭

I also remember the day you kissed me on the cheek. I was like, uh WHAT?? but I didn’t say anything. Inside my head, I was panicking like, NO WAY HE LIKED ME BACK. THIS IS CWAZY.

I mean… now it all makes sense. Because honestly, who does all this with their friends? 😭

But jokes apart, I think the main reason I never questioned it back then was because I felt safe with you. You were my safe place. My best friend. And yeah… my crush.<br>
I like you. I love you. Bohot zyada.</p>
